This is a fictional sharing economy type website demonstrating how one might implement a website used to share items.

The implementation uses Stripe for payments, and includes things like accepting or rejecting a request for a reservation, taking a deposit and scheduling a refund automatically (using rufus-scheduler), and other standard features of this type of website.
